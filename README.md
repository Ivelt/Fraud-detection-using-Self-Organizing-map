# Fraud-detection-using-Self-Organizing-map
This dataset contains 18,000 applications. it's about an Application to get access to a certain credit card at a certain bank. I keep the data private but if you want to get access to it as well you will just let me know and i can send it to you through your email. I will use the Self-Organizing Map (SOM) which is a Deep learning algorithm to try to understand the dataset and try to retrieve fraudulent applications. And later on I will provide a certain probability for each application to be fraudulent. In this case we can define with the bank  a certain threshold to be considered as fraudulent.
